# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup ðŸš€

## Overview
This document explains the GitHub Pages deployment configuration for the Maria Clara love story website.

## Problem Solved
The issue was that despite having a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow, the deployment to GitHub Pages was failing. The problem statement was: "as mudanÃ§as nao foram hospedadas no githubpages, faÃ§a isso agora" (the changes were not hosted on GitHub Pages, do this now).

## Root Cause Analysis
The deployment failures were caused by:

1. **Missing GitHub Pages Permissions**: The workflow lacked proper permissions to deploy to GitHub Pages
2. **ESLint Errors**: 10 ESLint errors were blocking the `lint-and-test` job which prevented deployment
3. **Outdated Deployment Action**: Using third-party action instead of official GitHub Pages action

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Updates

#### Added Proper Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write      # Required for GitHub Pages deployment
  id-token: write   # Required for authentication
```

#### Updated Deployment Strategy
- **Before**: Used `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`
- **After**: Used official GitHub Pages actions:
  - `actions/configure-pages@v4`
  - `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3`  
  - `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

#### Added Environment Configuration
```yaml
environment:
  name: github-pages
  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

#### Added Concurrency Control
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

### 2. ESLint Configuration Improvements

#### Updated Ignore Patterns
```json
{
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "*.min.js",
    "swiper-bundle.min.js", 
    "aos.js",
    "node_modules/**",
    "dist/**"
  ]
}
```

#### Added Missing Globals
```json
{
  "globals": {
    "AOS": "readonly",
    "Swiper": "readonly",
    "define": "readonly"
  }
}
```

### 3. Code Quality Fixes

#### Fixed ESLint Errors
- âœ… Removed unused variables and imports
- âœ… Fixed function declarations in blocks by converting to arrow functions
- âœ… Removed unused parameters from event handlers
- âœ… Cleaned up import statements in test files

#### Examples of Fixes
```javascript
// Before: Function declaration in block (ESLint error)
function showMusicMessage(message) {
  // ...
}

// After: Arrow function (ESLint compliant)
const showMusicMessage = (message) => {
  // ...
}
```

## Deployment Flow

### Automatic Deployment Trigger
```mermaid

    A[Push to main] --> B[GitHub Actions]
    B --> C[lint-and-test job]
    C --> D[deploy job]
    D --> E[verify-deployment job]
    E --> F[Site Live ðŸŽ‰]
```

### Workflow Jobs
1. **lint-and-test**: Runs ESLint, TypeScript check, unit tests, E2E tests, accessibility tests, and Lighthouse tests
2. **deploy**: Builds the project and deploys to GitHub Pages (only on main branch)
3. **verify-deployment**: Validates the deployment and runs post-deploy Lighthouse tests

## GitHub Pages Configuration Required

To complete the setup, ensure in the repository settings:

1. **Go to Settings > Pages**
2. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
3. **No custom domain needed** (using default `ezrafchev.github.io/site-para-maria-clara`)

## Site URLs
- **Production**: https://ezrafchev.github.io/site-para-maria-clara/
- **Version Check**: https://ezrafchev.github.io/site-para-maria-clara/version.txt

## Build Configuration

### Vite Build Output
- **Output Directory**: `dist/`
- **Assets Directory**: `dist/assets/`
- **PWA Assets**: Automatically generated service worker and manifest

### Key Features Deployed
- âœ… Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- âœ… Service Worker for offline functionality  
- âœ… Web App Manifest for mobile installation
- âœ… Apple Touch Icons for iOS devices
- âœ… Optimized assets and performance

## Monitoring & Verification

### Automatic Checks
- **Deployment Verification**: Checks if the correct SHA is deployed
- **Lighthouse Tests**: Ensures performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO scores â‰¥90
- **Version Tracking**: Each deployment creates a `version.txt` file with the commit SHA

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Check deployed version
curl https://ezrafchev.github.io/site-para-maria-clara/version.txt

# Check site is live  
curl -I https://ezrafchev.github.io/site-para-maria-clara/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Deployment fails with permission error**
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
   - Verify the workflow has proper permissions

2. **ESLint errors block deployment**
   - Run `npm run lint` locally to identify issues
   - Fix errors or update `.eslintrc.json` configuration

3. **Build fails**
   - Run `npm run build` locally to test
   - Check Vite configuration and dependencies

4. **Site shows 404**
   - Verify GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - Check if the workflow completed successfully

## Next Steps

With this setup complete:
- âœ… Future pushes to `main` will automatically deploy
- âœ… Pull requests will run tests but not deploy
- âœ… The site will be available at the GitHub Pages URL
- âœ… Performance and accessibility are automatically monitored

The love story website is now properly hosted and will stay up-to-date with every change! ðŸ’–
